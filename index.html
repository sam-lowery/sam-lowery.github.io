     <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 100px;">The tutors you need, all in one place.<br></h2>
     <p style="padding-left: 100px;">
       Falcon Tutor is a free web-based service that
       enhances the opportunity for academic success
       amongst cadets. The platform connects cadets
       across the cadet wing for tutoring services.
       Furthermore, it enables cadets to register as tutors
       across various academic departments and courses
       within those departments. The Air Force Academy has one
       of the most rigorous academic programs in the country,
       in part due to the exhaustive core curriculum.
       Consequently, cadets are constantly in search of help
       in many of their courses. Finding credible resources to
       aid in academic understanding and for completing assignments
       can be difficult. Falcon Tutor provides cadets with
       an avenue for finding credible help. Many squadrons already have unofficial
       lists of tutors within their squadron. Falcon Tutor serves
       as a more official platform for connecting cadets to tutors,
       not only within their own squadron, but across the entire wing.
       Cadets can access various features of the website through easy
       to use web forms. Cadets can individually
       create Falcon Tutor accounts where they can search for tutors.
       Specifically, Falcon Tutor,allows cadets to use filters
       when searching for tutors. These filters include
       departments, classed, and squadrons. Each cadet can also register as a tutor
       and add classes they are qualified to tutor for. Instructors may also register,
       allowing cadets to find other professors teaching their classes.<br><br>

         Falcon Tutor ensures that every userâ€™s information will remain private.
         Privacy and usability are our primary concerns; however, we understand our
         platform may raise some concerns regarding USAFA's Honor Code. If students use our
         website as an avenue for cheating, that student is ultimately liable.
         We believe, however, that Falcon Tutor will help reduce cheating by
         providing easy access to authorized resources
         rather than unauthorized ones such as those on the internet. We encourage
         that all cadets seeking tutoring services check and follow the help policy of their
         assignment beforehand.
