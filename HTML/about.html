            <p style="margin-left: 7.5%">
                In July 2021, I completed a three-week internship with Amazon Web Services. I Worked<br>
                with a small team of AWS engineers on a DOD contracted project which aimed at<br>
                bringing augmented reality capabilities to deployed military environments. I helped<br>
                build the first non-functional prototypes of the system and delivered these to the team for<br>
                future research and development. The internship helped develop my skills in the C#<br>
                coding language, software engineering, and augmented reality concepts.
